oh. this is a project, 
notes are about what im forgetting i guess

create a dict from lists
    ZIP method on dict type

dict(zip(keys,values))
dict() creates an empty dict
zip(keys,values) puts those together

zip is a dict method

NOPE doing the Unguided one, there is an insurmountable error in the Netflix one having to do w the jupyter notebook not finding the correct stuff

DICT CREATE
#### zipping lists to create a dictionary
    keys = ['a', 'b', 'c']
    values = [1, 2, 3]
xdict = zip(keys, values)


DICT read
get value given the key
get key given the value - must loop over all

loop over all dict?
